  p2: 'My professional focus as a cellist for the past 10 years has been in the studio. My recordings have found their way to the BBC, Chanel 4, Syfi, the blockbuster game, Mass Effect, and many UK and US feature films. Before that, and since graduating with a B Mus degree in 1999, I played in professional orchestras (both full time and freelance); with rock bands, acoustic songwriters and cabaret artists; I even ran away with No Fit State Circus for a brief stint as their cellist in 2006!',
